### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I've performed my studies at the ITCL Marco Polo Bari, achieving a high-school diploma in accounting and computer planning. Originally, I worked in different telemarketing firms with good results of sale for then to reach my last experience as accountant where I've developed more awareness of my competencies. Now, I'm attending a professional course for Web Developer.
In my free time, I dedicate myself to the reading and my passions as photography and the sport.
Now:
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript depth and React
